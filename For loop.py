x=['jaffar', 987,'alexa']

for i in x:
    print(i)


#     Below for loop will print the value form 0 to 9
for i in range(10):
    if(i%5!=0):

        print(i)





# So the syntax is pretty different from java for loop
# Couple of differences like , we do not need to initize the i variable, by defualt it start with 0. Also it will point to first object in the list
